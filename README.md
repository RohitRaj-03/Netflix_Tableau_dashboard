Netflix Dashboard with Tableau
I started by getting data from Kaggle, a big community for data science. I got a CSV file and opened it. The file had info about movies and TV shows like their titles, directors, countries, and ratings.
I used Tableau, which is a tool for making visualizations. It's like a big table where you put data to make graphs and charts. You can use columns and rows to organize the data. You can also use filters to choose certain parts of the data, like removing empty rows or picking only the top 10 things.
In my project, I made 10 different pages. Each page had different data and pictures. I used marks to change how the graphs looked. I even made the graphs match the colors of the Netflix logo. I also made the pages look nice by changing colors and adding pictures.
Then I put all the pages together on a big page called a dashboard. It showed different things about movies and TV shows, like which ones were popular in different countries, ratings, and years. I added the Netflix logo too.
So, my final dashboard had lots of info and pictures about different movies and TV shows, that describe for us different types and different titles of movies by country , by rating and by year.
